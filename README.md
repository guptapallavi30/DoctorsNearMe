# Create and Publish a Mobile App
DoctorsNearMe helps in narrowing your search of doctors/specialists in your area for general or emergency use. The experience aside, I chose to make a particular app because, while Google does a good job in presenting doctor-related information, the application makes it easier to contact the doctors through direct calling and to find their relative distance from your location. It also allows you to see the insurances that the doctors accept, making it easier to find a specialist that makes your medical needs more affordable. Because affording healthcare is a privilege and hard-earned money spent, its important to find doctors that can help you effectively and cover your insurances, and this app hopes to do just that.
